# CIS Benchmarks

## Introduction
The [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) provides a internationally recognized [list of guidelines](https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/) for systems configurations, developed by multiple cybersecurity experts, in order to harden these systems' security. These configuration are mapped to multiple estabilished standards, such as Europe's ISO series of standards, NIST SP 800-53 and Cybersecurity Framework, HIPAA, and others.

What this project aims to do is to slowly add some of the many benchmarks listed, initially using shell scripts to assess and score a system according to the appropriate benchmark.
